An application for working with food recipes, where user can search recipes by title or category, add recipes to favorites or create his own recipe, that other people can use. User also can work with an ingredients for selected recipe(add them to shopping list, check if you had one etc.). Each ingredient has image from our database.  Site has 3 breakpoints for mobile, tablet and desktop screens. You can change between light and dark theme. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

There was a learning team project with own [backend](https://github.com/jkl303/so-yummy-teamproject-back.git) and database created with MongoDB.

In front-end part of app I was responsible for Add recipe page. I used react hooks, redux, formik, react select and other libraries in my work.
